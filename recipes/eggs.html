    <p>Knowing how to poach an egg is easy to master, and there are many different methods to try. One thing to remember is that the fresher an egg is, the easier it is to poach – so choose eggs with the latest best-before date on for poaching. This is because egg whites become more fluid the older they are which means they are more likely to disperse in the water once submerged. A spoonful of vinegar in the water can help with this, and will not change the flavour of your egg.

        Soft or hard? This really is a personal choice; some people prefer their eggs to be runny (soft), others prefer cooked all the way through (hard) and some like something in between. There is no wrong or right way, although some people will argue to the bitter end with you on that point! The longer we poach an egg the more it will start to cook the yolk, so make sure to get your timings right if you don’t want to be disappointed!
        
        Depending on which method of poaching you use, a saucepan lid may be required. If this is the case then make sure to maintain the temperature of the water within the pan. The initial temperature of the egg will also affect how long it will take to cook so remember that if you use your egg straight from the fridge it will take longer to cook.</p>
