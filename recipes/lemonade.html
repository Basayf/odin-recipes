    <p>Simple syrup is a thick and sweet syrup used to sweeten a variety of different drinks. Why is this important for lemonade? If you just stir the sugar into cold water, it will sink to the bottom and won’t dissolve. We promise it’s quick and so worth it!

        The simple syrup really is the secret to the perfect lemonade recipe, and it allows you to adjust the sweetness of the mixture to your liking. Just add the syrup slowly to the freshly squeezed lemon juice, and then taste test to find the right balance.</p>
